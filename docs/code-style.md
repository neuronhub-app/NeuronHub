# Code Style

## Core Principles

### You must write dumb, self-documented code

- Devs overestimate self intelligence - KISS
- Extract explanatory variables and functions

Comments
- Comments are a terrible code smell, and are only for unusual cases (tell why, not what)
- Every comment is a tech debt, it'll fuck up devs once outdated

### You must manage complexity

You're working on a pre-MVP pre-PMF codebase:
- Extreme complexity engineering is a must for survival
- We must avoid the hell of "*cheaper to rewrite from 0 than comprehend*"
- You must minimize surface area - every line of code is tech debt

#### Defensive code is tech debt

- Always prefer clean code instead handling potential library issues
- Fail fast - use `assert` or `!` instead of complex error handling
- Assume backend enforces invariants. Use `?.` chaining, not defensive `if`s
- Don't conceal errors instead of sending to Sentry. 

#### Best practices

- Define variables at point of use
- Functions > 20 lines → decompose. Think of later debugging prod at 3am.
- When objects are used only in one place - keep them together, esp if file is below 200 LOC
- Single-use vars → inline as named args
- In functions accept objects over primitives: `update(user: User)` not `update(id: string)`
- Avoid "smart" constructs as `reduce` or list comprehensions 
- Create wrappers to declutter bad syntax from third-party

## React

### Components

```tsx
export function UserCard(props: { user: User; className?: string }) {
  // 1. Defaults
  const className = props.className ?? "default";
  
  // 2. Hooks
  const userSnap = useSnapshot(user.state);

  // 3. State
  const state = useValtioProxyRef({ isDialogOpen: false });

  // 3. Handlers
  function handleClick() { }

  // 4. Render values - closest to usage in JSX
  const name = props.user.name ?? "Anonymous";

  return (
    <DialogRoot
      open={state.snap.isDialogOpen}
      onOpenChange={event => state.mutable.isDialogOpen = event.open }
    >
    </DialogRoot>
  );
}
```

### Chakra v3

In `src/components/ui` is bad code generated by Chakra CLI. Chakra dropped the idea, so we're replacing it with import from `@chakra-ui/react`.
