## Desc

We're creating the new app `jobs`, taking `profiles` as the base, and importing the data from the real CSV of `.local/pg-jobs.csv` and `pg-orgs.csv`.

The basic BE and FE works. Still a week worth of work, but we'll handle it one task at a time.

### `apps.jobs` files

- models.py - `Job`, `JobAlert`
- index.py
- graphql.py
- services/csv_import.py
FE
- apps/jobs/list/JobList.tsx
- apps/jobs/list/JobsSubscribeModal.tsx
- apps/jobs/list/JobCard/JobCard.tsx
- apps/jobs/subscriptions/JobAlertList.tsx
